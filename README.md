# Short Project every day

Every day, I create and upload mini-projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on GitHub. 
These include simple yet fun tools and games like color generators, alarm clocks, and blackjack. 
Most of these are inspired by online repositories and mini-project sources—not entirely original—but I make sure to fully understand and recreate them before sharing. 
It's a fun way to learn and build consistently!
